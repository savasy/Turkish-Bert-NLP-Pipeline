# Turkish-Bert-NLP-Pipeline
## Pipeline in a nutshell
In this project we aim at building Bert-base NLP pipeline for Turkish;  Name Entity Recognition (Ner), Sentiment Analysis, Question Answering, _**Summarization**_ and _**Text Categorization**_.

* For the pipeline in a nutshell, please check the file [**Turkish NLP Pipeline- Quick Start .ipynb**](https://github.com/savasy/Turkish-Bert-NLP-Pipeline/blob/master/Turkish%20NLP%20Pipeline.ipynb)
* For detailed application please check [**Turkish NLP Pipeline (For Detailed Presentation).ipynb**](https://github.com/savasy/Turkish-Bert-NLP-Pipeline/blob/master/Turkish%20NLP%20Pipeline%20Presentation.ipynb)
